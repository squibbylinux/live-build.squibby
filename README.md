live-build.squibby
==================

This package contains the small hacks we need to do on live-build
to get it to work for us. In the long term these should be merged
upstream as much as possible.

"upstream" in this context is both the original live-build project
http://live.debian.net/, git://live.debian.net/git/live-build.git
as well as the ubuntu patched version of live-build as found in
the release squibby is based on (right now this release is 12.04,
"Precise Pangolin")
