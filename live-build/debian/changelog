live-build (3.0~a24-1ubuntu33~squibby0.1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add upstream commit 40a8a8ee7523240f4657b768909a9ed92fcfebc5 to fix the
    "missing console-common" issue (LP: #975861)
  * Fix "E: Can't find package" during build of CD pool, by inserting
    an apt-get update before the apt-get install.
  * When livecd was building its cdpool, it was starting from a zeroed
    dpkg status file. This resulted into pulling *all* dependencies,
    (around 1G size) which clearly doesn't work for an ubuntu derivative.
    Fixing this got cdpool size down to ~32M which is acceptable.
  * live-build wants to add live-config which doesn't work for us (we are
    an ubuntu derivative and don't use live-config)
