Description: Always remove apt lists for pockets other than the release one
 The installer doesn't need non-release pocket lists and these are taking
 up quite a bit of space on the media.
 .
 These other pockets changing quite frequently, they will usually have to
 be re-downloaded by the time the system is installed anyway.
